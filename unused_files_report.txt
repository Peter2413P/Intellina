UNUSED FILES REPORT
Generated on: 2026-01-11

The following files have been identified as unused or replaced in the current version of the Intellina Website (Members Page Optimization Refactor).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. COMPONENT: MagicBento
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files:
- src/components/MagicBento.js
- src/components/MagicBento.css

Reason for Removal:
This component was the original implementation for the layout. It has been entirely replaced by the `FlipCard` based grid in `Members.js` to support better performance and the new design requirements. The styles are no longer imported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. COMPONENT: UpsideDownHero
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files:
- src/components/UpsideDownHero.js
- src/components/UpsideDownHero.css

Reason for Removal:
The "Upside Down" header logic has been moved directly into `Members.js` (using `StrangerTitle`) to allow for tighter integration with the state (flicker effects, world switching) and better performance control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. COMPONENT: InteractiveMemberCard (Legacy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files:
- src/pages/members/InteractiveMemberCard.js

Reason for Removal:
This was an earlier, heavier iteration of the member card with complex mouse tracking and particle effects. It has been superseded by `FlipCard.js` (and `FlipCard.css`), which implements optimized versions of these effects (or disables them on low-end devices).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. EFFECT: DualRealityTransition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files:
- src/components/effects/DualRealityTransition.js
- src/components/effects/DualRealityTransition.css

Reason for Removal:
The transition effect between worlds is now handled by `BlackHoleTransition.js` and the CSS transitions in `members.css`. This file is no longer imported or used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. STYLE: Portal Button
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files:
- src/pages/members/portal-button.css

Reason for Removal:
The portal button was replaced by the `MagicalDie` component. The styles in this file are for the old HTML button and are no longer applied to any element.
